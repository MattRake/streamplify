The goal of this library is to provide useful Java 8 streams and to assist you in building new streams that allow efficient parallel processing.

The utilities offered by Streamplify include:

- combinatorics streams: permutations, combinations, cartesian products etc.
- classes that help you implement your own efficient parallel streams.

NOTE: The source code is available on https://github.com/beryx/streamplify[GitHub].
